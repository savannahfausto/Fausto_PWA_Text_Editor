# A Breakdown of JATE Text Editor Challenge


## Description of Week 19 Challenge: PWAs or Progressive Web Applications

The motivation behind creating this project was to build a text editor that runs in the browser as a single-page application. 

This project was built to demonstrate the functionality of Progressive Web Apps or PWAs. Since the application meets PWA criteria, a user can download the application and run it on their computer like a native app with a desktop icon as well. 

This project allows for users to have a text editor that runs without internet due to multiple means of data persistence to make sure the application is usable across many browsers.

This project reinforces concepts that go into making a PWA such as webpack, service workers and indexedDB.
